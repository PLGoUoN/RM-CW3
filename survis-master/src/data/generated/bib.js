        "abstract": "\"{ In recent years, research into gender differences has established that individual differences in how people problem-solve often cluster by gender. Research also shows that these differences have direct implications for software that aims to support users' problem-solving activities, and that much of this software is more supportive of problem-solving processes favored (statistically) more by males than by females. However, there is almost no work considering how software practitioners\u2014such as User Experience (UX) professionals or software developers\u2014can find gender-inclusiveness issues like these in their software. To address this gap, we devised the GenderMag method for evaluating problem-solving software from a gender-inclusiveness perspective. The method includes a set of faceted personas that bring five facets of gender difference research to life, and embeds use of the personas into a concrete process through a gender-specialized Cognitive Walkthrough. Our empirical results show that a variety of practitioners who design software\u2014without needing any background in gender research\u2014were able to use the GenderMag method to find gender-inclusiveness issues in problem-solving software. Our results also show that the issues the practitioners found were real and fixable. This work is the first systematic method to find gender-inclusiveness issues in software, so that practitioners can design and produce problem-solving software that is more usable by everyone. }\",",

Since these features have separately been shown to help end users problem solve, it is important to female end users\u2019 productivity that we find ways to make these features more acceptable to females.

The on-demand nature of IoT devices requires a responsive communications channel, which is often at odds with thorough authentication and access control. This paper seeks to better understand IoT device security by examining the design of authentication and access control schemes. In this work, we explore the challenge of prop\u0002agating credential revocation and access control list modifications in a shared IoT ecosystem. We evaluate the vulnerability of 19 popular security cameras and doorbells against a straightforward user-interface bound adversary attack. Our results demonstrate that 16 of 19 surveyed devices suffer from flaws that enable unauthorized access after credential modification or revocation. We conclude by discussing these findings and propose a means for balancing authentication and access control schemes while still offering responsive communications channels.",

        "abstract": "This paper explores issues that come up in practices of breakage and repair through two projects: the 'XO' laptops of One Laptop Per Child in Paraguay and public sites of facilitated repair in California, USA. Collectively drawing on 15 months of ethnographic fieldwork, 156 interviews, and archival research, we find that breakdown and repair are not processes that designers can effectively script ahead of time; instead, they emerge in everyday practice. These practices are shaped by material, infrastructural, gendered, political, and socioeconomic factors -- such as manufacturing limitations, access to repair parts and expertise, and environmental convictions -- which designers often did not, and may not have been able to, anticipate. We call the material realities and practices of repair negotiated endurance, which is illustrated by four themes from our findings: the negotiated identification of breakdown, collaborative definitions of worth, the fraught nature of collaborative expertise, and the gendered stakes of repair.",

        "abstract": " The Internet of Things (IoT) is more complex and abstract than previous information and communication technologies as there are many connections occurring. New challenges for users arise from increased amount of data, decisions made automatically, less visibility and more ambiguity, and magnified security and privacy risks. There is a fair chance that only a selective group will benefit,\u00a0making it important to study IoT from a digital inequality perspective. The current study focused on health, home, and security related IoT by conducting a survey among a representative sample of the Dutch population. The study was guided by resources and appropriation theory. IoT attitudes and material access as well as educational and income differences play an important role. Those with higher education and those with higher incomes have more positive attitudes and are the first to actually buy IoT. This also means that they are the first to develop the required skills and to engage in a diverse IoT use. The results suggest that to make the IoT attractive for larger parts of the population, clear terms of use and user-friendly IoT should be an important objective. Stimulating positive attitudes towards IoT will increase the likelihood of IoT ownership, development of IoT skills, and, eventually, a wider diversity of IoT use. Policies should aim to stress the potential outcomes IoT has to offer and should promote transparency and disclosure of how personal data is used as well as better privacy, security practices and regulation.",

        "abstract": "With the increasing spread and pervasiveness of technologies, the role of gender in the design of these technologies is a topic of growing importance. Several conference panels and journal issues have focused on the contributions feminism, gender theory, and queer theory can make to HCI. This paper discusses the key developments in the sub-field of Gender HCI over the past five years. We discuss, in particular, how recent approaches to gender in HCI move past questions of how men and women interact differently with technologies. Scholars are focusing on activist, intersectional, and reflexive approaches to gender and identity in design that focus on inclusion and accountability in terms of who technologies are designed for and in what ways. This scholarship draws on a wide variety of theoretical approaches to gender not integrated or well-known in the general literature or education in HCI or computing. We recommend the implementation of a Gender 101 general education module for all computing students to provide fluency in gender theory as a way to promote discussion, inclusivity, and accountability in interaction design and computing practices and organizations.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: This study investigates gender and generational differences in consumers\u2019 familiarity, security concern, and intentions to purchase Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Design/methodology/approach: This study surveys 463 undergraduate business students at a large North American university. Findings: Findings suggest that men are more familiar with IoT devices than women (p<0.001), but concerns about the security risks associated with these devices influence women\u2019s purchase intentions more than men\u2019s (p<0.1). Furthermore, younger generations are found to be more concerned about IoT security risk (p<0.1) and more influenced by risk in their intentions to purchase IoT devices (p<.05), than are older generations. No evidence was found for gender differences in security concern nor for age differences in IoT familiarity. Practical/social implications: The gender and generational differences found here suggest producers of IoT technologies could increase consumers\u2019 purchase intentions by developing more secure IoT devices and by providing clearer explanations of their security risks. Originality/value: Despite widespread adoption of IoT devices, few studies consider how demographic characteristics may influence consumers\u2019 perceptions of these technologies. This study contributes to both the information systems and marketing literatures by investigating how gender and generation may influence consumers\u2019 IoT familiarity, security concern, and purchase intentions.",
